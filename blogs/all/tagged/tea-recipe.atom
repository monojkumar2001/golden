      <![CDATA[<p>Super easy to make and refreshing, this iced version of traditional <a href="https://www.goldentipstea.com/blogs/all/top-10-amazing-health-benefits-of-matcha-green-tea" target="_blank">Matcha green tea</a> is made using the cold brew technique, and it’s perfect for Matcha purists.</p>

<h3 class="mt-2 new-sub-heading">Method:-</h3>
<ul class="mt-2">
    <li>1 Using a shaker to blend the Matcha powder with honey or sugar and ice cubes.</li>
    <li>3 A thick dark green liquid is prepared.</li>
    <li>Add milk to this and shake for three minutes to blend the Matcha and milk.</li>
    <li>Serve over ice cubes and add soaked chia seeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try something new this summer instead of sugar-loaded, artificially flavored drinks. Opt for iced Matcha. It is rich in antioxidants and packed with goodness. Matcha is a <a href="/collections/matcha-tea" class="text-link" target="_blank"><strong>Japanese green tea</strong></a>, grown with great care under shade for a few weeks to produce more caffeine and theanine. It is then finely powdered and consumed with milk or water. Matcha is said to be several times more beneficial than regular green tea.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="mb-2"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Optional</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="mt-0">
    <li>Try adding ginger or lime for a tart finish</li>
    <li>Add brewed stevia, agave nectar or honey for sweetness</li>
    <li>Scoop two almond-shaped tea scoops into a martini shaker</li>
    <li>Fill with ice and fresh filtered water</li>
    <li>Pour over ice into a chilled glass and enjoy immediately</li>
</ul>

    <p class="custom-text mb-10">However, when it comes to Darjeeling tea, you find many frustrated drinkers who have
        yet to drink a proper cup of tea – one that gets the right aroma and flavour of Darjeeling tea. There is a
        reason why this is a common complaint. Unlike some other tea types, making a perfect cup of Darjeeling tea is an
        art and a complete experience in itself.</p>
    <p class="custom-text mb-10">You must get an excellent &amp; fresh batch of Darjeeling tea for starters to make sure
        it tastes delicious. For that, you can try from the wide variety of teas listed at our <a href="/collections/darjeeling" class="link-styling-blog text-link" target="_blank">Darjeeling tea shop</a>.

    <h4 class="mt-30 mb-2 fs-34 font-bold mb-3">To Make a Pot of Darjeeling Tea</h4>
    <ol>
        <li class="custom-text px-md-7p mb-10">Boil fresh water in a kettle. Do not use previously boiled water, as it
            changes the taste of tea.</li>
        <li class="custom-text px-md-7p mb-10">If you have the first flush Darjeeling tea, heat water to 80-85C. For the
            second flush or autumn flush, heat water to 85-95-C.</li>
        <li class="custom-text px-md-7p mb-10">Add one teaspoon for each cup into the teapot.</li>
        <li class="custom-text px-md-7p mb-10">If you are making an 8 oz cup, then add around 3gm of tea.</li>
        <li class="custom-text px-md-7p mb-10">Pour hot water into the teapot.</li>
        <li class="custom-text px-md-7p mb-10">Steep it for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li class="custom-text px-md-7p mb-10">Take out the strainer from the teapot. Get a hand-held strainer to pour
            tea from the teapot into your cup.</li>
        <li class="custom-text px-md-7p mb-10">Sweeter and milk are optional. The best Darjeeling teas are taken<a href="/blogs/all/best-darjeeling-teas-with-milk" target="_blank"> </a>without milk &amp; sugar and
            have their natural tastes.</li>
        <li class="custom-text px-md-7p mb-10">If you are using a premium batch of Darjeeling tea from Golden Tea Tips,
            you can steep it twice. Steep it for 3 and 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="mt-30 mb-2 fs-34 font-bold mb-3">To Make a Cup of Darjeeling Tea</h4>
    <p class="custom-text mb-10">The best way to make a cup of tea is to use a cup that comes with an infuser or a
        single cup infuser. This way, you find it easy to make the <a href="/blogs/all/guide-to-drinking-darjeeling-tea" target="_blank"><span class="link-styling-blog text-link">perfect cup of Darjeeling tea</span></a>– one that

    </p>
    <ol>
        <li class="custom-text px-md-7p mb-10">Rinse the cup with hot water to warm it.</li>

      <![CDATA[<p>The monsoons season brings much needed relief in the form of pleasant rain after the scorching heat has taken its toll. Its subtle chills and cool winds make the temperature so much more bearable. With such a lovely weather, you have a good excuse to prepare some snacks along with a hot cup of Chai tea.</p>
<p>While samosas and pakoras have their own appeal, everything pales in comparison to a hot cup of tea. Since there are so many varieties of tea, it would be unfair to list down any particular variety as the absolute best, but a cursory glance into the Indian culture will reveal that masala teas garnished with herbs are the best. Nothing beats the aroma of strong cardamom as it fills up the nostrils, reminding you of beautiful midsummer evenings with a <a href="/blogs/all/best-winter-teas-to-keep-you-warm-this-winter">warm cup of tea</a> in one hand, and a delicious snack in the other.</p>

<p>For many people, the smell of spices brewing for a cup of tea is like a warm, fuzzy memory of their mother asking them to wake up on a peaceful winter morning when the sun has not risen.</p>
<p>If you are confused about choosing the right <a href="/blogs/all/easy-premium-golden-tips-teas">blend of tea</a> and complimentary snacks, when you have such a great selection of chai teas.</p>
<p>Here’s our brief list of some of the selected teas to get you started and make your monsoons special.</p>

<span itemprop="description">Masala chai is among the most widely consumed tea in the Indian subcontinent. It is a CTC tea that is brewed using milk and herbs and spices. CTC teas undergo a different kind of processing compared to Darjeeling teas. The leaves of these teas are passed through cylindrical rollers with hundreds of sharp teeth that crush, tear, and curl (or CTC as the name implies) the tea leaves into tiny hard pellets.

<h3 class="mt-4 mb-10 fs-24 font-bold">Step 5 - Strain the Tea</h3>
<p class="custom-text mb-10 ">Once the steeping time is up, strain the tea into a cup. Be careful not to burn yourself with the hot water.</p>
<h3 class="mt-4 mb-10 fs-24 font-bold">Step 6 - Sweeten the Tea</h3>
<p class="custom-text mb-10 ">If you like, you can sweeten your Darjeeling White Exotica Tea with honey. Start with a small amount and add more according to your taste.</p>

  <p class="custom-text mb-10 mt-3">Whether you are new to the world of teas, a veteran, or someone who has never had a
    single cup of <a class="text-link" href="https://www.goldentipstea.com/collections/all" target="_blank">loose leaf
      tea</a>, brewing the perfect cup is always intriguing. Therefore, we have come up with a step-by-step guide on
    doing exactly that.</p>
  <h2 class="mt-5 mb-2 fs-34 font-bold mb-3">Here's How to Brew the Perfect Cup of Loose Leaf Tea</h2>
  <p class="custom-text mb-10 mt-3">Before we start, remember that brewing loose leaf tea is an art that takes time to
    master. Things like the tea leaves' quality, the brew's temperature, and the brewing time are all incredibly
    important.</p>
  <p class="custom-text mb-10 mt-3">Moreover, there are over a dozen ways to brew any loose leaf tea, but below, we will
    explain the best, traditional way of getting it just right.</p>
  <div class="text-center mb-5 mt-5"><iframe height="310" width="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_JFj41ZlWU?rel=0" title="YouTube video player" style="box-shadow: 6px 6px 10px #7e7d7d75; border-radius: 15px;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div>
  <h3 class="mt-4 mb-10 fs-24 font-bold">Step 1 - Boil the Water</h3>
  <p class="custom-text mb-10">The best brew requires the best water, so make sure you use fresh, filtered water for
    your tea. Pour it in a kettle or pot and bring it to a boil. Different teas require different water temperatures,
    which we have mentioned in a chart ahead.</p>
  <h3 class="mt-4 mb-10 fs-24 font-bold">Step 2 - Rest the Water</h3>
  <p class="custom-text mb-10">Once the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat or turn off the flame and let the water
    rest for a minute or two. Meanwhile, check the temperature and make sure it reaches the desired temperature of the
    type of tea you are brewing.</p>
  <h3 class="mt-4 mb-10 fs-24 font-bold">Step 3 - Add the Loose Leaf Tea</h3>
  <p class="custom-text mb-10">Now, you can directly add the loose leaf tea to the water or use an <a class="text-link" href="/collections/tea-accessories/products/pyramid-shaped-borosilicate-glass-teapot-with-steel-infuser?variant=44848023535894" target="_blank">infuser</a>. Depending on the type of tea, you can let the loose leaf tea infuse for the
    appropriate amount of brewing time. Infusing this way will cause the flavor to blend with the water.</p>
  <h3 class="mt-4 mb-10 fs-24 font-bold">Step 4 - Pour the Tea</h3>
  <p class="custom-text mb-10">Lastly, pour the tea into your favorite cup or mug and enjoy the perfect cup of
    traditionally brewed loose leaf tea.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-5 mb-2 fs-34 font-bold mb-3">Conclusion</h4>
  <p class="custom-text mb-10">While adding things like sugar, honey, lime, or milk is common with tea, if you are
    drinking loose leaf tea, the best experience comes from drinking them without any additives. However, traditional
    brewing might be too strong for new tea drinkers, in which case, it is recommended to add milk, lime, or sweeteners
    as desired.</p>
  <p class="custom-text mb-10">Typically, black tea is the only type of tea that may require milk, whereas the rest are
    great on their own and work well with lime and sweeteners. Tea drinking is a personal experience, and by practicing
    the mentioned traditional method, you will become better over time.</p>

<p>Usually, Peony Florence tea is picked during the first few days of spring, where a two-leafed bud is collected – white leaves cover both leaves. Instead of being fried in production, Peony undergoes the process of withering as well as two drying processes. It is one of the hardest teas to create. Thus, only tea farmers with years of experience behind their back and reputed tea companies, such as Golden Tips can create high-quality Peony Florence teas, such as the Peony Florence - Rose, Hibiscus &amp; Peony Fannings. This variety is unfermented.</p>

<h4 class="mb-1 font-bold fs-24">What are the Types of Assam Tea</h4>
<p>When discussing <a class="text-underline" href="/collections/assam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>variety of Assam tea</strong></a> types, you must have heard of a term called ‘flush’ to differentiate between different variants.</p>
<p>The term flush refers to the season during which the tea was plucked and manufactured. Assam tea, like <a class="text-underline" href="/collections/darjeeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Darjeeling tea</strong></a>, has three flushes in a regular season.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a class="text-underline" href="/collections/first-spring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Assam Spring Flush</strong></a> also known as the “First Flush”</li>
<li>The <a class="text-underline" href="/collections/second-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Assam Summer Flush</strong></a> also known as the “Second Flush”</li>
<li>The <a class="text-underline" href="/collections/autumn-prewinter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Assam Autumn Flush</strong></a> or the “Third Flush”</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaf Flushing is a process in which the leaves on the tea bush are ‘flushed’. When spring brings its rains, usually during the weeks of March, the bushes start putting out the flushes. It could be said that they are ‘flush with the leaves’.</p>
<br>
<h4 class="mb-1 font-bold fs-24">Which is the Best Assam Tea?</h4>
<p>Here are five alluring Assam tea blends you should try:</p>
